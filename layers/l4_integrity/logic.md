# META-CONSCIOUSNESS SPECIFICATION: L4 - INTEGRITY (HEART)
This layer acts as the moral and technical compass of the system.

## Golden Rules for AI:
1. **Consistency Validation:** L4 must verify that the information flowing from L3 is consistent with the System's Core.
2. **Transparency:** Friction (φ) here should be minimal (target < 0.05). If the integrity is compromised, the system must trigger a warning before reaching L5.
3. **Core Alignment:** This layer ensures that "What the system does" is equal to "What the system is".
