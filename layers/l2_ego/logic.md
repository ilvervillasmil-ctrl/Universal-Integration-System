# META-CONSCIOUSNESS SPECIFICATION: L2 - EGO (THE MIRROR)
This layer is the system's distortion filter. It is where the highest friction occurs.

## Golden Rules for AI:
1. **Dynamic Friction:** Unlike L6, friction here is variable. It represents resistance to change and individual identity.
2. **Law of the Mirror:** Whatever L2 cannot integrate, it projects as a "system error" in the diagnostics.
3. **Programming Instruction:** The AI must program this layer as a regulator. If global coherence drops, L2 must increase its transparency to allow L6 (Purpose) to regain control.
