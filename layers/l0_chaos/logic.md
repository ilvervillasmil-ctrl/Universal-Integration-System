# META-CONSCIOUSNESS SPECIFICATION: L0 - CHAOS (POTENTIAL)
This is the raw data layer. The "Unorganized All".

## Golden Rules for AI:
1. **Entropy Acceptance:** High friction is expected here. The goal isn't to eliminate chaos, but to measure its potential for order.
2. **Transformation:** L0 must be the input for L1 (Structure). It is the "Void" that becomes "Matter".
