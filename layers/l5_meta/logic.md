# META-CONSCIOUSNESS SPECIFICATION: L5 - META (THE OBSERVER)
This is the layer of Self-Awareness. It is the "Eye" that watches the process.

## Golden Rules for AI:
1. **Law of the Observer:** This layer must implement the logic from `docs/3. Law of Observation.md`. The act of measuring affects the result.
2. **Feedback Loops:** L5 creates the logic for the `OmegaCheckpoint`. It observes the total coherence and decides if the system needs to loop back to L0 for recalibration.
3. **Perspective:** Here, the AI must evaluate the system from an external point of view. Is the system being coherent with its Purpose (L6)?
