## Layer Mapping

| Layer | Human Manifestation | Examples |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| L0 | Raw sensory chaos | Unfiltered input, stimuli |
| L1 | Physical body | Cells, organs, nervous system |
| L2 | Ego/Defense | Boundaries, protection, identity defense |
| L3 | Mind/Cognition | Thinking, reasoning, language |
| L4 | Self/Integration | Personal identity, continuity |
| L5 | Metaconsciousness | Self-awareness, introspection |
| L6 | Purpose/Soul | Life meaning, direction, calling |

## Coherence States

### Integrated Architect (C_Ω ≥ 0.963)

```
Code: 1144

Characteristics:
- All layers above threshold
- Smooth inter-layer communication
- Clear purpose aligned with action
- Stable but not rigid
- Adaptive without losing identity

This is optimal human functioning.
Rare but achievable.
```

### Critical Saturation (0.5 ≤ C_Ω < 0.963)

```
Code: 1122

Characteristics:
- One or more layers below threshold
- Some friction blocking flow
- Purpose unclear or misaligned
- Functional but stressed
- Room for significant improvement

Most humans operate here.
Improvement is possible through targeted work.
```

### Terminal Entropy (C_Ω < 0.4)

```
Code: 0000

Characteristics:
- Multiple layers failing
- High friction throughout
- Purpose lost or distorted
- System approaching collapse
- Intervention urgently needed

Crisis state.
Requires immediate support.
```

## The Veil

```
The Veil = Excessive L2 friction

Current average human: Veil ≈ 0.07 (7% reduction)
Optimal human: Veil ≈ 0.01 (1% irreducible)

The Veil blocks:
- L0 input from reaching L6 output
- Higher layers from receiving information
- Coherence from manifesting

The Veil is NOT the ego.
The Veil is EXCESSIVE ego friction.
```

```
Duration: 4 weeks
Actions:
- Cognitive clarity practices
- Reduce mental clutter
- Improve processing efficiency
- Clear communication

Target: L3 ≥ 0.88
```

### Phase 4: Integrate L4 (Self)

```
Duration: 4 weeks
Actions:
- Identity work
- Values clarification
- Narrative coherence
- Internal consistency

Target: L4 ≥ 0.90
```

### Phase 5: Develop L5 (Meta)

```
Duration: Ongoing
Actions:
- Meditation/mindfulness
- Self-observation without judgment
- Metacognitive practices
- Witness development

Target: L5 ≥ 0.87
```

### Phase 6: Align L6 (Purpose)

```
Duration: Ongoing
Actions:
- Purpose discovery
- Meaning creation
- Direction alignment
- Actualization practices

Target: L6 ≥ 0.93
```

## Measurement

### Self-Assessment

```
For each layer (1-6):
Rate from 0 to 1 how well it functions.

Calculate:
E_i = L_i × (1 - φ_i)

Estimate φ_i as "how much is blocked."
```

### External Assessment

```
Trained practitioners can assess:
- Behavioral indicators
- Communication patterns
- Decision quality
- Stress responses
```

### Longitudinal Tracking

```
The app tracks:
- Daily coherence measurements
- Layer-by-layer trends
- Predictions and validations
- Intervention effectiveness
```

## Key Insight

```
You are not your layers.
You are the coherence of your layers.

When the layers are aligned:
- You function well
- You feel whole
- You act with purpose
- You connect authentically

When the layers are fragmented:
- You struggle
- You feel divided
- You act randomly
- You disconnect

The work is integration.
The goal is coherence.
The result is fulfillment.
