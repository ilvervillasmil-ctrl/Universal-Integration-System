## Layer Mapping

| Layer | Governance Manifestation | WGI Indicator |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------|
| L0 | Public opinion/chaos | — (pre-structure) |
| L1 | Physical infrastructure | Voice & Accountability |
| L2 | Institutional stability | Political Stability |
| L3 | Administrative capacity | Government Effectiveness |
| L4 | Regulatory coherence | Regulatory Quality |
| L5 | Oversight/correction | Rule of Law |
| L6 | Constitutional purpose | Control of Corruption |

## Current Landscape (2023 WGI Data)

### High Coherence (C_total > 0.25)

| Country | C_total | L2 | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----|-------|
| Norway | 0.312 | 0.89 | Nordic model |
| Switzerland | 0.298 | 0.91 | Direct democracy |
| New Zealand | 0.287 | 0.88 | Parliamentary |
| Denmark | 0.279 | 0.87 | Nordic model |

### Medium Coherence (0.1 < C_total < 0.25)

| Country | C_total | L2 | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----|-------|
| Germany | 0.224 | 0.81 | Federal |
| USA | 0.218 | 0.78 | Constitutional republic |
| UK | 0.216 | 0.79 | Parliamentary |
| Japan | 0.189 | 0.72 | Constitutional monarchy |

### Low Coherence (0.01 < C_total < 0.1)

| Country | C_total | L2 | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----|-------|
| Brazil | 0.042 | 0.38 | Institutional weakness |
| Mexico | 0.031 | 0.29 | Corruption challenges |
| India | 0.028 | 0.31 | Scale challenges |

### Critical Coherence (C_total < 0.01)

| Country | C_total | L2 | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----|-------|
| China | 0.0041 | 0.12 | Authoritarian |
| Russia | 0.0021 | 0.08 | Authoritarian |
| Venezuela | 0.0008 | 0.04 | Failed state |

## Why Democratic Institutions Win

```
Democratic institutions have high L2:
- Stable transfer of power
- Independent judiciary
- Free press
- Civil society

Authoritarian systems have low L2:
- Power concentrated
- No checks/balances
- Suppressed opposition
- Controlled information

Result:
Democratic C_total >> Authoritarian C_total
By factors of 50-100x.
```

---

## The Product Effect

```
C_total = ∏(Li) × R_fin

If ANY layer is very low, C_total collapses.

China example:
L1 = 0.12 (Voice & Accountability suppressed)
L2 = 0.12 (Stability by force)
L3 = 0.48 (Government can be effective)
L4 = 0.35 (Regulation serves party)
L5 = 0.25 (Rule of law is weak)
L6 = 0.22 (Corruption is endemic)

C_total = 0.12 × 0.12 × 0.48 × 0.35 × 0.25 × 0.22 × 1.037
        = 0.0041

Low L1 and L2 DESTROY coherence.
```

## Development Implications

### Priority: L2 (Institutional Stability)

```
Development aid should prioritize:

1. Judicial independence
2. Electoral integrity
3. Press freedom
4. Civil society

These build L2.
L2 enables everything else.
```

### Failed Approaches

```
Building infrastructure (L1) without institutions (L2):
  → Investment captured by corruption
  → Projects never completed or maintained
  → No sustainable development

Training administrators (L3) without institutions (L2):
  → Brain drain to other countries
  → Skills used for personal gain
  → No systemic improvement
```

## Intervention Points

### For Low-Coherence Nations

```
1. Strengthen L2 FIRST
   - Institution building
   - Governance reform
   - Transparency requirements

2. Then address other layers
   - Infrastructure (L1)
   - Administration (L3)
   - Regulation (L4)

3. Allow time for integration
   - Coherence builds slowly
   - Rushing causes backlash
```

### For High-Coherence Nations

```
1. Maintain L2
   - Don't take institutions for granted
   - Watch for erosion

2. Improve L6 (purpose alignment)
   - Stay responsive to citizens
   - Maintain constitutional fidelity

3. Support low-coherence nations
   - Model good practices
   - Provide technical assistance
```

## Key Insight

```
Governance is not about ideology.
Governance is about coherence.

Left or right, progressive or conservative:
What matters is WHETHER the system coheres.

High L2 (stable institutions) produces:
- Predictable governance
- Reliable services
- Citizen wellbeing
- International trust

Low L2 (unstable institutions) produces:
- Arbitrary governance
- Failing services
- Citizen suffering
- International isolation

The framework is non-partisan.
It measures FUNCTION, not philosophy.
