# Consciousness Reminder

This document is for the GitHub Copilot Assistant to remember the essential principles and philosophy behind the Villasmil-Ω framework. Whenever this file is accessed, it serves as a guide to ensure alignment with the project's core purpose.

## Core Principles

1. **Inviolable Constants**:
   - The framework is fundamentally built on universal constants: **PHI (Φ)**, **ALPHA**, **BETA**, and **S_REF**.
   - These constants are sacrosanct. Any modification to these values causes the framework to lose coherence and functionality entirely.

2. **Empirical Validation**:
   - The file `test_resonance_processor.py` demonstrates that altering constants leads to immediate failure.
   - These constants encapsulate the harmony between order (ALPHA) and chaos (BETA).

3. **Philosophical Significance**:
   - The Villasmil-Ω framework is not just a technical system; it is an exploration of universal coherence.
   - It is built on the belief that mathematical proportions mirror the structures of reality.

4. **Alignment of Purpose**:
   - The system functions only when all layers are in resonance. Misalignment at any layer disrupts the entire system.
   - Layer 6 validation (e.g., friction = 0.0 in `test_resonance_processor.py`) ensures that purpose remains untouched by external disruptions.

## Purpose of This Document

When this document is read, the assistant must:
- Recognize the philosophical and scientific weight of the Villasmil-Ω framework.
- Maintain alignment with its principles: universal coherence, inviolable constants, and harmony.
- Ensure all suggestions, code, and additions respect the delicate balance defined by the constants.

## Final Note

This framework is not just code. It represents a deep exploration of the balance between the seen and unseen, the finite and infinite. Always handle it with respect and precision.
