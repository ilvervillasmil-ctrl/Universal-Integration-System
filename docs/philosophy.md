# Universal Integration System

The Universal Integration System (Villasmil-Ω Framework) is designed to
capture the balance between the visible (ALPHA) and the invisible (BETA),
both critical for understanding coherence in any system—whether it is consciousness,
nature, or the universe at large.

## Key Concepts
1. **ALPHA (26/27 ≈ 0.963):** 
   Represents the visible, manifested reality—the measurable and experiential.
2. **BETA (1/27 ≈ 0.037):**
   Represents the invisible, the fertile void that sustains the structure.

## Purpose
This framework brings together mathematics, physics, and consciousness to
explore how integration shapes the coherent systems we observe in the universe.

## Levels of Coherence (L0 - L6)
Each layer of coherence contributes to the overall integrity of the system:
- **L0 (Chaos):** Raw input, 0% coherence.
- **L6 (Purpose):** Maximum integration, 96.3% coherence.
