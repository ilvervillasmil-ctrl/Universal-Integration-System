"""
TEST OF STRUCTURAL SELF-PREDICTION
===================================
A system that predicts how it will fail — and fails exactly that way —
demonstrates internal coherence. Not intelligence. Structure.

Each test forces a limit condition. The framework predicts the outcome.
If the actual result matches the prediction, the system is coherent.
If it doesn't, the framework is falsified.
